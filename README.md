# Project 09: Machine Learning in Business
 
**Objective:** Determine which among three regions strikes the best balance between being a profitable and a low-risk location for the development of new oil wells by the mining company OilyGiant.

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, I needed to identify at least one region with a risk of losses no greater than 2.5%. I discovered that exactly one region fits this description, with a risk of losses of only 1.5%. Additionally, the linear regression model I built predicts the amount of product in that low-risk region with root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.89. Lastly, the standard deviation of the volume of oil reserves in that region as predicted by the linear regression model is virtually equal to the actual standard deviation (46.01 and 46.02, respectively).

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data analysis and interpretation, linear regression, bootstrapping, budget management, and risk assessment
